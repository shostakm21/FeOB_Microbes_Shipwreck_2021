# Iron-Oxidizing Bacteria on a Ferrous-Hulled Shipwreck

Data analysis within RStudio from 16s Amplicon Sequencing of microbial samples from Accomac shipwreck.

## This study aims to determine the relative species abundance & community diveristy trends across a freshwater shipwreck

Throughout history, iron and steel-hulled ships have sailed across Earth’s oceans transporting people and various goods; however, many either sink to the bottom of a river, ocean, and/or lake, or are disposed of. In time, they take on a new role in the environment as an artificial reef for the vast community of organisms who claim freshwater and marine water as their home. They also serve as a historical ‘stamp’ in time, but due to natural chemical and biological processes the iron and steel-hulled shipwrecks eventually corrode, leaving significantly less left. This is caused by the microbially-influenced corrosion (MIC) communities of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and iron-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) feeding on the byproducts of the degradation of those components.
