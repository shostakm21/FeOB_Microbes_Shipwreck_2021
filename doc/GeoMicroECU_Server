## GeoMicroECU Server
### Data & Resource Managment

- You must be using the Cisco AnyConnect VPN before you can access the server
- Raw data should be stored in *.zip* format
- Before starting analysis, check the number of available threads using
```
htop
```

- To check how full disks are, use:
```
df -h
```

## Version Control & Reproducibility

- Keep a record of all commands you run, use:
```
history
```

### Starting on the GeoMicroECU Server

- Log onto the server in terminal:
```
ssh geomicroecu@150.216.93.221
```

- Enter the server password _ ECUM1cr0bes_ and press "y"
- Enter the correct directory where you will store data
```
cd /media/geomicroecu/RAID-1
```

- Once in RAID, enter you directory using:
```
cd shostakm
```

### Running Programs on the Server

- Before running a code start either
```screen
```

or 

```tmux

- To find a specific program that's part of the $PATH use:
```
which ProgramName 
```

- Some programs/scripts will need to be run using the absolute path & can be found:
```
ls -lh /home/geomicroecu/scripts/
```

- When exiting the server, first exit either "screen" or "tmux" & then exit the serving holding down keys:
```
ctrl+a+d
```

- To exit the server use:
```
exit
```

## Mother Analysis
### Setting Input/Output Directories

- Set input directory
```
>set.dir(input=C:/Users/Maggie/Desktop/Mothur.win_64/mothur
```

- Set output directory
```
>set.dir(
